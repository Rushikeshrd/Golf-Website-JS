# Golf-Website-JS

USE DESKTOP NOT MADE RESPONSIVE!!

This repository contains a cloned version of a golf-related website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The current version does not feature full responsiveness across various devices and screen sizes but serves as a foundational project to demonstrate front-end web development skills.

I have made this site as a clone site of SIDCUP GOLF for practice purpose. All Copyrights & credits belongs to the real owner of site.
